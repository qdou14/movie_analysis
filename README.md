# Project2_movie_analysis
- Qing Dou
## Introduction
In this project, I will embark on a comprehensive journey to explore and analyze movie-related data from three distinct sources, each with its unique perspective on the film industry. Our objective is to harness the power of Python programming, data parsing, web scraping, and API interactions to extract, process, and analyze data for insightful conclusions.

* Part 1: XML Parsing with Fandango: Parsing Fandango's XML sitemap to extract movie listings and organize them into a structured DataFrame for analysis.

* Part 2: API Interaction with Bechdel Test Database: Utilizing the Bechdel Test API to gather data on films and rating, compiling this information into an analyzable dataset.

* Part 3: Web Scraping Rotten Tomatoes: Extracting data about Golden Globe Best Film winners from Rotten Tomatoes through web scraping, to analyze trends in critically acclaimed movies.

* Part 4: Analyzing Dataset Connections: Investigating the relationship between gender representation in films from the Bechdel Test data (Part 2) and their critical acclaim as reflected in Rotten Tomatoes' Golden Globe winners data (Part 3).
